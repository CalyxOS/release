<h4>CalyxOS 2.10.0 - October 2021</h4>
</p>
<p style="border: 1px solid;">
<b>Note:</b>
Google has stopped updating this device. This means that
they will not provide any more updates to the closed-source components,
such as the bootloader, modem firmware, and other firmware.
However, updates to the open source OS code and the Linux kernel
can still be merged by us, and are included in this build.

<h4>CalyxOS 2.14.0 - Android 11</h4>
</p>
<p style="border: 1px solid;">
<b>Note:</b>
This is the final CalyxOS update for this device. Google stopped updating the Pixel 2 after Dec 2020.
Up till now, we provided extended support by patching the open source components: AOSP and the Linux kernel. Linux kernel 4.4 was a long-term support kernel, but has stopped receiving updates this month.
Unfortunately it is also not feasible to have Android 12 fully working on these devices. There are various community efforts, but there's no fully working port as far we know.
As such, we have decided to stop updating these devices. Apps such as Chromium and microG will still continue getting updates.

<h4>CalyxOS 2.14.0 - Android 11</h4>
</p>
<p style="border: 1px solid;">
<b>Note:</b>
This is the final CalyxOS Android 11 build for this device. We're currently working on getting Android 12 working, so far it looks quite promising. We'll keep posting updates on our website.
Do note that Xiaomi has stopped providing updates for this devices.
We've been keeping the open source components updated, and that's included in this build.
Additionally, the proprietary firmware componets are from September 2020,
since trying to upgrade to anything newer ends up factory resetting the device.

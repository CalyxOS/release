      "message": "Changelog looks good and is identical for all devices except tegu, where the sole difference is the version number of 6.10.10 instead of 6.10.20.\n\nIn this checkout, every -beta7, -security-express7, and -testing file for a given device is identical, which is correct.\n\nIf the metadata used for testing last week has the same content as the -testing files, then this all looks good to me. I spot-checked rhode and it matched. I assume the others do as well.",

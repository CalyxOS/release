<h4>CalyxOS 2.14.0 - Android 11</h4>
</p>
<p style="border: 1px solid;">
<b>Note:</b>
This is the final CalyxOS update for this device. Google stopped updating the Pixel 2 after Dec 2020.
We provided extended support by patching the open source components, however Linux 4.4 has
stopped receiving updates. It is also not feasible to have Android 12 fully working on this device.
As such, we have decided to stop updating this device. Apps such as Chromium and microG will still continue getting updates.

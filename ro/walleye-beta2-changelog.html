<h4>CalyxOS 2.14.0 - Android 11</h4>
</p>
<p style="border: 1px solid;">
<b>Note:</b>
This is the final CalyxOS update for these devices. Google stopped updating the Pixel 2 series as of December 2020.
Up till now, we extended these phones useful lifetimes by patching the open source components: AOSP and the Linux kernel. Linux kernel 4.4 was a long-term support kernel, but has stopped receiving updates this month.
Unfortunately due to the kernel dependency, it is also not feasible to have Android 12 fully working on these devices. There are various community efforts, but there's no fully working port as far we know.
As such, we have decided to stop updating these devices. Applications such as Chromium and microG will still continue recieving updates.
